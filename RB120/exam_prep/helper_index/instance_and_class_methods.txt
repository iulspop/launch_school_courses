15. What is the difference between instance methods and class methods? Show how each is created and used.

An instance method can only be called on an object instanciated from the class.
```ruby
class Animal
  def eat; end
end

Animal.new.eat # On the instance, yes!
Animal.eat # Nope
```

A class method can only be called on the class itself. It's defined using a different syntax. The method name appended to `self.`. Self in this context references the class, so the method is defined on the class.

```ruby
class Animal
  def self.eat; end
end

Animal.eat # On the class, yes!
Animal.new.eat # Nope, not available to the instance
```
