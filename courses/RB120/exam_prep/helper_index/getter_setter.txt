11. What are getters and setters? Show the different ways to create them.
By default, the data that the instance variables of an object reference is not accessible from outside that object.

For example, when I create an instance of this class, there's no way for a user of that object to access the data referenced by `@name`:
```ruby
class Player
  def initalize
    @name = 'Long Pants'
  end
end

a_player = Player.new
a_player.name # => NoMethodError
```

`@name` is scoped to the object referenced by `a_player`. That state is encapsulated within the object and protected from outside access.

Getters and setters are methods used to expose an interface to "get" or read that data and "set" or write to that data.

```ruby
class Player
  def initalize
    @name = 'Long Pants'
  end
end

a_player = Player.new
a_player.name # => NoMethodError
```
