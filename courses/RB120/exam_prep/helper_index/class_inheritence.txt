5. What is class inheritence? Show how it works in Ruby.
It's a code reuse mechanism that allows a class to inherit behaviour from another class. They are called the subclass and superclass respectively.

It works in Ruby like this:
```ruby
class Vehicle
  def accelerate; end
end
class Car < Vehicle; end
```
The `<` token is used to make the subclass on the left inherit from the superclass on the right.

Now, the `accelerate` method can be called on instances of the `Car` class.
```ruby
Car.new.accelerate
```
That instance method is not defined on the `Car` class, but it can called on instances of that class, because the superclass was added to the method lookup path by making the subclass inherit from it.
