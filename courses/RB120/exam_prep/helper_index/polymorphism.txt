6. What is polymorphism? Show how it's applied with class inheritence.
Polymorphism is when objects of that are instances of different classes respond to the same method call with their own implementation. In other words, when different kinds of objects respond to the same message. The details of how objects of different types respond to the message are independent and can be very different.

On way to accomplish polymorphism is through class inheritence:
```ruby
class Vehicle
  def accelerate
    # increase speed
  end
end

class Car < Vehicle
  def accelerate
    super
    # call sub-systems
  end
end

class Motorcycle < Vehicle
  def accelerate
    super
    # call different sub-systems
  end
end

car = Car.new
motorcycle = Motorcycle
```

In the above example, the instance of the `Car` class and the instance of the `Motorcycle` class are different types of objects, but can respond to the same interface `accelerate`. From a user's point of view, using the two objects is the same, but the details of the implementation can be very different.
