7. What is the method lookup path? Show how it works in Ruby.
The method lookup path is how Ruby resolves what method to execute. Each object has a method lookup path that starts with the class it is an instance of and is followed by the chain of inheritence of that class.

Below, I display the method lookup path for an Integer object.
```ruby
num = 5
puts 5.class.ancestors
# Integer
# Numeric
# Comparable
# Object
# Kernel
# BasicObject
```
`5` is an instance of the `Integer` class. So, if I call a method on that object, like for example `5.abs`, then Ruby will search for an instance method defined on each of those classes starting with `Integer` down through `BasicObject`. The first instance method to be found that matches the name is executed, so methods further up the inheritence hierarchy are ignored.
