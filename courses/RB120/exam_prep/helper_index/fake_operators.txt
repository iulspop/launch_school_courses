10. What are fake operators in Ruby? Explain how they work.
Fake operators are methods that can be used with operator-like syntax in Ruby.

For example, we can define an instance method called `+` on a custom class:
```ruby
class Container
  attr_reader :size

  def initialize(size)
    @size = size
  end

  def +(other)
    Container.new(size + other.size)
  end
end

a = Container.new(50)
b = Container.new(50)
c = a + b
puts c.size # => 100
```

The `+` instance method is not a operator in the sense that it is not a construct built in to the language. It looks like one syntactically, but in reality it is an instance method of a particular class. This affords users of Ruby a lot of flexibily, since fake operators can defined and overwritten on any class to provide an intuitive interface for certain operations.
