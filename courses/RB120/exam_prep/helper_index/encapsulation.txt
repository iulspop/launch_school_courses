3. What is encapsulation and is the benefit of using it in programming?
Encapsulation is taking data and the methods that operate on that data and putting them inside a container. The result is the data is protected from outside access. A public interface is defined to interact with the behaviour and data of the container.

```ruby
class Dog
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def print_dog_info
    puts name
  end

  private

  attr_reader :name
end
```
